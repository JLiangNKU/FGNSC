This package contains the Matlab codes implementing subspace clustering by orthogonal matching pursuit as described in "Scalable Sparse Subspace Clustering by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit", CVPR 16.

The method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art clustering performance on Extended Yale B face database and the MNIST handwritten digit database and is computationally efficient.
